Hierarchical Clustering:

The dendrogram generated by hierarchical clustering helps visualize the natural groupings within the data. It helps determine the potential number of clusters. It provides insights into how customers naturally group based on their purchasing behavior and credit limits in the dataset.

K-means Clustering:

The Elbow method used in K-means clustering helps determine the optimal number of clusters The "elbow" point in the plot indicates a diminishing return on reducing WCSS, suggesting the optimal number of clusters. Visualizing the resulting clusters helps clearly segment the customer base according to their purchase amounts and credit limits
